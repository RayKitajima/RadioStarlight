## Why Radio Starlight

Radio Starlight turns the internet into a programmable broadcast. Mix live feeds, APIs, and web pages with your own show structure, then generate segment scripts, cover art, and a consistent on‑air personality—on demand. Whether you want a quick auto‑generated show or a handcrafted lineup, Radio Starlight gives you both.

## What makes it different

**1) Segment‑first creative control**
Manually design your program structure. Decide which segment uses which content source and guide generation with your own prompts. Build repeatable templates like:

* **Opening** → Weather, and headline roundup
* **Music*** → Playback from playlist
* **Deep Dive** → Discussion (e.g., Hotly debated research paper)
* **News Corner** → Selected RSS/Atom/JSON feeds
* **Outro** → Personality‑driven sign‑off

**2) Bring your own content**
Blend the web however you like:

* **Feeds:** RSS, Atom, JSON
* **API content:** Any accessible API (e.g., calendar/events, knowledge bases)
* **Page content:** Any public webpage

**3) Bring your own AI**
Use the models that fit your workflow and constraints:

* **Cloud APIs:** OpenAI, Google Gemini, and more
* **On‑device (Apple):** Apple’s **Foundation Models** and **Image Playground** for private, low‑latency generation on compatible Apple devices

**4) Personality & sound that feel like “radio”**
Define a **custom on‑air personality** (tone, style, quirks) and pair it with **Sound Sets** for BGM and stingers. Generate **cover images and avatars** to brand each show or series.

**5) Basic Program + Custom Program**

* **Basic:** Auto-generate a complete program from your chosen sources.
* **Custom:** Full control over segments, prompts, sources, and visuals for consistent, repeatable shows.

**6) Open publishing**
Publish everything—**designed programs**, **generated broadcasts**, **the feeds/APIs/pages you used**, **personalities**, and **Sound Sets**—using the open protocol from the Starlight Catalog Service (open‑source):

This makes your shows **shareable, remixable, and reproducible** across the ecosystem.

## How it works (end‑to‑end)

1. **Collect**
   Add feeds (RSS/Atom/JSON), connect APIs, and point to pages you care about.

2. **Design**
   Create your program structure: name segments, assign content sources, and attach a prompt to each segment.

3. **Choose engines**
   Pick a text LLM for script generation and an image model for show art. Use cloud APIs or Apple on‑device models if you can use. 

4. **Generate**
   Produce segment scripts, covers, and avatars. Keep your **personality** and **Sound Sets** consistent across episodes.

5. **Publish**
   Export your designed program, generated broadcast, and source references using the Starlight Catalog Service protocol for transparent attribution and easy sharing.

## Who it’s for

* **Indie creators & streamers:** Spin up daily or weekly shows without a production team.
* **Community radio & campus media:** Standardize formats and share templates with volunteers.
* **Brands & publishers:** Turn owned content and APIs into evergreen or topical radio formats.
* **Educators & museums:** Build narrative tours from trusted sources.
* **Open‑source tinkerers:** Publish and remix using a transparent, portable catalog.

---

## Example formats you can build fast

* **Morning Briefing:** Headlines + “On this day” + local culture spotlight
* **Tech Weekly:** Product updates from feeds + deep‑dive API segment + Q\&A roundup
* **City Beat:** Neighborhood events (calendar API) + community notices (pages) + music interludes
* **Evergreen Series:** Long‑form explainers with a consistent persona and branded cover art

---

## Key advantages

* **Creative control:** Prompts and structure at the segment level = consistent, signature shows.
* **Choice of models:** Use the best engine for each job—cloud when you need scale, on‑device when privacy or offline is critical.
* **Transparency & attribution:** Publish sources with your broadcast so audiences and collaborators can verify and remix.
* **Reusable assets:** Personalities and Sound Sets plug into any show, so you can scale formats quickly.
* **Future‑proof:** Open protocol (Starlight Catalog Service) keeps your work portable.

---

## Responsible generation (good practice, built in)

* Encourage clear **source attribution** for every segment.
* **On‑device options** to keep sensitive workflows local on compatible Apple hardware.
* Designed for **remix culture** with responsible sharing through open metadata.
