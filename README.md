## Why Radio Starlight

Radio Starlight turns the internet into a programmable broadcast. Mix live feeds, APIs, and web pages with your own show structure, then generate segment scripts, cover art, and a consistent on‑air personality—on demand. Whether you want a quick auto‑generated show or a handcrafted lineup, Radio Starlight gives you both.

## What makes it different

**1) Segment‑first creative control**
Manually design your program structure. Decide which segment uses which content source and guide generation with your own prompts. Build repeatable templates like:

* **Opening** → Weather and headline roundup
* **Music** → Playback from playlist
* **Deep Dive** → Discussion (e.g., hotly debated research paper)
* **News Corner** → Selected RSS/Atom/JSON feeds
* **Outro** → Personality‑driven sign‑off

**2) Bring your own content**
Blend the web however you like:

* **Feeds:** RSS, Atom, JSON
* **API content:** Any accessible API (e.g., calendar/events, knowledge bases)
* **Page content:** Any public webpage

**3) Bring your own AI**
Use the models that fit your workflow and constraints:

* **Cloud APIs:** OpenAI, Google Gemini, and more
* **On‑device (Apple):** Apple’s **Foundation Models** and **Image Playground** for private, low‑latency generation on compatible Apple devices

**4) Personality & sound that feel like “radio”**
Define a **custom on‑air personality** (tone, style, quirks) and pair it with **Sound Sets** for BGM and stingers. Generate **cover images and avatars** to brand each show or series.

**5) Basic Program + Custom Program (Pro)**

* **Basic:** Auto‑generate a complete program from your chosen sources.
* **Custom (Pro):** Create and edit your own program templates with full control over segments, prompts for consistent, repeatable shows. *(Requires subscription)*

**6) Publishing & sharing (optional)**
When you want to share, you can export programs and assets using the open **Starlight Catalog Service** format (self‑hosted static files). It’s **not required** for everyday use.

## How it works (end‑to‑end)

1. **Collect**
   Add feeds (RSS/Atom/JSON), connect APIs, and point to pages you care about.

2. **Design**
   Create your program structure: name segments, assign content sources, and attach a prompt to each segment. *(Custom design requires Pro.)*

3. **Choose engines**
   Pick a text LLM for script generation and an image model for show art—use cloud APIs or Apple on‑device models on compatible devices.

4. **Generate**
   Produce segment scripts, covers, and avatars. Keep your **personality** and **Sound Sets** consistent across episodes.
5. **Publish (optional)** 
   Export programs and assets in an open, portable format if you want to share.

## Publishing & sharing (optional)

* **Purpose:** Make your shows and building blocks portable, citable, and easy to import—only when you want to.
* **What you can share:** Programs, generated Broadcast, Persons (personalities), Sound Sets, and content presets (Feeds/API/Page).
* **How it works:** Export from Radio Starlight → run a small tool to generate a static folder of JSON + media → host anywhere (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
* **How others use it:** Paste your catalog URL in Radio Starlight to browse/import; “Featured” folders surface items in a simple carousel.
* **Good practice:** Publish with source attribution so broadcasts are transparent and remixable.

> The **Starlight Catalog Service** is open‑source and separate from the app. Use it only if publishing matters to you.

---

## Who it’s for

* **Indie creators & streamers:** Spin up daily or weekly shows without a production team.
* **Community radio & campus media:** Standardize formats and share templates with volunteers.
* **Brands & publishers:** Turn owned content and APIs into evergreen or topical radio formats.
* **Educators & museums:** Build narrative tours from trusted sources.
* **Open‑source tinkerers:** Publish and remix using a transparent, portable catalog.

---

## Example formats you can build fast

* **Morning Briefing:** Headlines + “On this day” + local culture spotlight
* **Tech Weekly:** Product updates from feeds + deep‑dive API segment + Q\&A roundup
* **City Beat:** Neighborhood events (calendar API) + community notices (pages) + music interludes
* **Evergreen Series:** Long‑form explainers with a consistent persona and branded cover art

---

## Key advantages

* **Creative control:** Prompts and structure at the segment level = consistent, signature shows.
* **Choice of models:** Use the best engine for each job—cloud when you need scale, on‑device when privacy or offline is critical.
* **Transparency** — Clear source attribution baked in.
* **Reusable assets:** Personalities and Sound Sets plug into any show, so you can scale formats quickly.
* **Portable (when needed)** — Optional open publishing keeps your work future‑proof.

---

## Responsible generation (good practice, built in)

* Encourage clear **source attribution** for every segment.
* **On‑device options** to keep sensitive workflows local on compatible Apple hardware.
* Design for **remix culture** with open, lightweight metadata.
